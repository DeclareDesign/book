# Research Design Lifecycle

<!-- A research design starts from an idea, a kernel of a project. People arrive at their good ideas from every direction through idiosyncratic processes. Some people are inspired by their reading of academic literature, others are sparked by a conversation with colleagues and still others have their research questions thrust upon them by exigent circumstances. Ideas come from primary observation of social processes, reading secondary accounts by other authors, and our own past thoughts and lived experiences. An talent for research design can help you intuit which ideas seem promising, but it doesn't help directly with the process of ideation itself -- that has to come from scientific curiosity or need. -->

<!-- The goal of brainstorming is to build a complete design from this kernel, regardless of where in the four elements *M*, *I*, *D*, or *A* the idea starts out. Sometimes a "theory-first" approach to developing a research project is unhelpfully contrasted with a "methods-first" approach. Better might be to describe the "theory-first" approach as starting with *M* or *I* and an "opportunity-first" approach as starting with *D* or *A*. We should seek to provide credible answers to important questions, and often progress in providing credible answers will start with new data and answer strategies. That said, unimportant questions aren't worth the research investment, no matter the credibility of the answers -- worse still are unreliable answers to the biggest questions in social science. -->

A research design begins with a spark of inspiration or opportunity, develops through a planning phase, comes to fruition in the stages of realization, and adds to knowledge and influences decisions as it is integrated into collective scientific understanding. At each step in the research design lifecycle, your specification of *M*, *I*, *D*, and *A* shapes your choices and how others will learn from your work.

This part of the book works through stages of the research design lifecycle, illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:figure-20-1). As the nonlinear, circular path in the figure illustrates, the steps are all intertwined by their shared connection to the research design. We describe in each entry how we can use the declaration, diagnosis, and redesign framework to make progress at each step. Of course not every research project will feature each and every stage but the list should serve we hope as a useful checklist as you work through the major phases of your research.  

![The research design lifecycle](/figures/figure-20-1){#fig:figure-20-1}

We divide the research design lifecycle into three broad categories: planning, realization, and integration. Planning includes all of the activities you undertake before data collection starts: conducting ethical reviews, obtaining approvals,  organizing partnerships, securing funding, running pilots, gathering criticism, and filing analysis plans. Realization begins with the execution of the data strategy as planned, and continues through the inevitable changes that come with analytic challenges and scientific surprises. We trace realization through implementation, pivoting in response to unexpected developments, writing up results, reconciling planned and implemented designs, and responding to peer reviewers. In the final phase of a research project, the results are integrated into the scientific literature. Integration includes how the study will inform theories and decisions and also how the study will later be reanalyzed, replicated, and someday -- meta-analyzed.
