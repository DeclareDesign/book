When writing up an empirical paper, authors have two sets of goals. First, they want to convince reviewers and readers that the research question they are tackling is important and their research design provides useful answers to that question. Second, they want to influence scholars but also decision-makers like policymakers, businesses, and journalists. Communicating the elements of MIDA and a diagnosis of the design in a study write-up serve both goals. The declaration in terms of MIDA in the paper enables readers to understand what research design was implemented, and the diagnosis the inferential properties of the design.

Elements of MIDA may appear throughout a paper. In @fig-midamousa below, we annotate @mousa2020building by highlighting where in the article each design component is discussed. The study reports on the results of a randomized experiment in which Iraqi Christians were assigned either to an all-Christian soccer team or a team in which they would play alongside Muslims. The experiment tested whether being on a mixed team affected intergroup attitudes and behaviors, both among teammates and back at home after the games were over. We highlight in color areas discussing the model *M* in yellow, the inquiry *I* in green, the data strategy *D* in blue, and the answer strategy *A* in pink.

The model and the inquiry largely appear in the abstract and introductory portion of the paper, though aspects of the model are discussed later on. Much of the first three pages are devoted to the data strategy, while the answer strategy only appears briefly. This division makes sense: in this paper, the action is all in the experimental design whereas the answer strategy follows straightforwardly from it. The paper mostly describes *M* and *D*, with only a small amount of text devoted to *I* and *A*. Finally, it is notable that the data strategy is interspersed with aspects of the model. The reason is that the author is justifying choices about randomization and measurement using features of the model.
