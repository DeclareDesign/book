# Errata {.unnumbered}

These errata are errors in the printed book. These changes are implemented in this online version.

- On pg. 53, footnote 1: "Here we are referring to an "inquiry model" not a "reference model," as discussed in Section 2.2.1" should read "Here we are referring to an "inquiry model" not a "reference model," as discussed in Section 2.1.1".
- On pg. 69, Table 8.1, row 4: `cluster_ra` should be `cluster_rs`, and in row 6, `cluster_ra` should be `cluster_rs` and `strata_ra` should be `strata_rs`.
- On pg. 101: "The $p$-value is the probability this also goes with the misplaced section estimates of 15 or larger" should read "The $p$-value is the probability under the null model of obtaining estimates of 15 or larger."
