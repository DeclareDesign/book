# Errata {.unnumbered}

These errata are errors in the printed book. These changes are implemented in this online version.

- On pg. 53, footnote 1: "Here we are referring to an "inquiry model" not a "reference model," as discussed in Section 2.2.1" should read "Here we are referring to an "inquiry model" not a "reference model," as discussed in Section 2.1.1".
- On pg. 69, Table 8.1, row 1 now reads `simple_rs(N = 100, probÂ = .25)` instead of `simple_rs(N = 100, p = .25)`; row 2 now reads `complete_rs(N = 100, n = 25)` instead of `simple_rs(N = 100, p = 0.25)`; row 4: `cluster_ra` should be `cluster_rs`; and in row 6, `cluster_ra` should be `cluster_rs` and `strata_ra` should be `strata_rs`. Thanks to Bjorn Van Campenhout for identifying the first two errors.
- On pg. 101: "The $p$-value is the probability this also goes with the misplaced section estimates of 15 or larger" should read "The $p$-value is the probability under the null model of obtaining estimates of 15 or larger."
- On pg. 158: The second code block, which includes the code `MASS::mvrnorm`, should read `n = 1000` not `N = 1000`.

## Code updates

We are committed to maintaining the code in this book as the R ecosystem evolves. The following changes reflect differences between the printed book and the online version. 

- On pg. 103, Declaration 9.3 now reads `.summary = ~tidy(., exponentiate = TRUE)` instead of `.summary = ~tidy_stan(., exponentiate = TRUE)`, reflecting the use of the standard `broom.mixed` package for tidying stan objects. In addition, the library `rdss` is replaced with the library `broom.mixed` in the declaration.
