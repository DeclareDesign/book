# Errata {.unnumbered}

These errata are errors in the printed book. These changes are implemented in this online version.

- In Table 8.1, in row 4, `cluster_ra` should be `cluster_rs`, and in row 6, `cluster_ra` should be `cluster_rs` and `strata_ra` should be `strata_rs`.
- On pg. 101, "The $p$-value is the probability this also goes with the misplaced section estimates of 15 or larger" should read "The $p$-value is the probability under the null model of obtaining estimates of 15 or larger."
