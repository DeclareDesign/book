# Observational : descriptive

An observational design for descriptive inference usually has an inquiry like a population mean, covariance, or distribution as the main research goal. In an observational research design, the data strategy includes sampling and measurement components, but no treatments are allocated by the researcher. Put differently, in an observational design for descriptive inference, researchers seek to measure and summarize the world, but not to change it. This class of research designs encompasses a huge portion of research activity -- most surveys fall into this class, as do large-scale data collections of economic and sociopolitical indicators, classic case studies focused on "thick description," and many text analysis projects.
